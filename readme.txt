Hello!
This is a small collection of various projects, school assignments, and programming noodles. I hope that as I continue to grow as a programmer,
as will my reposatory. Some of the homework files were formatted rather unusually. Some folders do include the source files, others will also include
a word document of the screen shot of the code and results. This is the way my teacher wanted it submitted for grading so this is the way they have
been saved on my computer.
